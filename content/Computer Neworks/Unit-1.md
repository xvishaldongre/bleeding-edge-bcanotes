## LAN Components

### 1. Hardware Components

Following are the Hardware components-

1.  **Network Adapter Cards or Networking Interface Card (NICs)** - Circuit board or card installed in computer so that it can be connected to a network.
2.  **Server** - A computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other (client) computers over a local network or the Internet. A server may be three types:
    - File Server: A file server is a computer that stores files, is attached to a network, and provides shared access of those files to multiple workstation computers.
    - Print Server: A print server is a device that connects printers to client computers over a network. It accepts print request from the computers and sends the jobs to the appropriate printers over the LAN.
    - Communication Server: A communication server is a computer system designed to handle a wide range of communications-based applications.
3.  **Station** - A station is a computer that is connected with a server computer over the LAN, and communicate with other devices connected with it.
4.  **HUB** - A common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives atone port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all-packets.
5.  **Switch** - A switch is like a hub in that it is a central point for connecting network cables; however, a switch is able to receive a packet and transmit it to only the destination computer.
6.  **Router** - Routers make the connection to the Internet for LANs. They use a configuration table to decide where packets should go.
7.  **Access point** - A hardware device or a computer’s software that acts as a communication hub for users of a wireless device to connect to a wired LAN.
8.  **Power Supply** - Both wired and wireless networks need a power supply. A wireless network uses the current to generate radio waves. A cabled network sends data interpreted as an electronic pulse.
9.  **Connector** - A network connector refers to any device that used to connect many LAN connection with the hardware of the computer.
10. **Shared Peripheral Device** - A peripheral device is any device—such as a printer, hard disk drive, CD-ROM drive or modem—that is connected to and controlled by a computer. Any or all of these devices can be accessed by multiple users when connected to a LAN in the proper manner.

### 2. LAN Software

- Operating system of Server
- Opetating system of client (workstations)
- Application software accessed by LAN User

### 3. Users

- Users (Normal people who uses network resources.)
- Network Administrators (People who manages LAN network)

## Serial Data Format

Low-level protocol for communicating between two or more devices.

Sends and receives bytes of information in a serial fashion—one bit at a time.

These bytes are transmitted using either a binary format or a text (ASCII) format.

## Encoded data Formats

<!-- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital_communication/digital_communication_data_encoding_techniques.htm#:~:text=Encoding%20is%20the%20process%20of,information%20from%20the%20converted%20format. -->

**Encoding**- The process of converting the data or a given sequence of characters, symbols, alphabets etc., into a specified format.

**Decoding**- the reverse process of encoding which is to extract the information from the converted format.

**Data Encoding** - The process of using various patterns of voltage or current levels to represent 1s and 0s of the digital signals on the transmission link.

- **Encoding Techniques**
  - Analog data to Analog signals
  - Analog data to Digital signals
  - Digital data to Analog signals
  - Digital data to Digital signals

## Connection Oriented and Connectionless services

Connection-oriented service and Connection-less service are used for the connection establishment between two or more than two devices.

### Connection-oriented service

It is related to the telephone system. It includes the connection establishment and connection termination. In connection-oriented service, Handshake method is used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.

TCP (Transmission control protocol) is connection oriented network.

1. In this first connection is made before sending the message
2. It is a stream based transmission
3. In this receiver is first checked for authentication so chances of getting error are very less.
4. It is more reliable network.

### Connection-less service

Connection-less service is related to the postal system. It does not include any connection establishment and connection termination. Connection-less Service does not give the guarantee of reliability.

UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is connection-less oriented network.

1. In this no connection is established prior to sending message.
2. It transmits data as message.
3. There is no need to authenticate, so more likely to have error.
4. It is unreliable network.

## Switching Techniques

In large networks, there can be multiple paths from sender to receiver. The switching technique will decide the best route for data transmission.

**Classification:**:

- Circuit Switching
  - Space Division Switch
    - Crossbar Switch
    - Multistage Switch
  - Time Division Switch
- Message Switching
- Packet Switching
  - Datagram Approch
  - Virtual Circuit Approach
    - Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC)
    - Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)

### Circuit Switching

- It establishes a dedicated path between sender and receiver.
- Once the connection is established then the dedicated path will remain to exist until the connection is terminated.
- In a network operates in a similar way as the telephone works.
- A complete end-to-end path must exist before the communication takes place.
- Before sending data a request signal is sent to recevier then the receiver sends back the acknowledgment
- Fixed data can be transferred at a time

### Message Switching

It is a connectionless network switching technique where the entire message is routed from the source node to the destination node, one node at a time.

### Packet Switching

- Connectionless network switching technique
- The message is divided and grouped into a number of units called packets
- Packets has two parts: a header and a payload.
- Header contains the addressing information
- Payload carries the actual data
