# Security principles

The Principles of Security can be classified as follows:- 
1. **Confidentiality** :- The Principles specifies that only the sender and receiver will be able to access the informaction shared between them. Confidentiality compromises if an unauthorized person is able to access the message. For Example, let us consider sender A wants to share some confidential information with reveiver B and the information intercepted by the attacker C. Now the information is in the hands of an intruder C. 

2. **Authentication** :- Authentication is the mechanism to identify the user or system or the entity.
