# Introduction to Computers:

## History of development of Computer

The history of the computer dates back to several years. There are four prominent generations of computers. Each generation has witnessed several technological advances which change the functionality of the computers. This results in more compact, powerful, robust systems which are less expensive. The computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th century English mathematics professor name Charles Babbage. He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this design that the basic framework of the computers of today are based on.

## Computer system concepts

A computer system is a set of integrated device that take input give output and process the command which is given by the user, store data and when the user required some information from the computer it gives that data to the user as per their need.

## Characteristics

- **Speed** - Speed means the duration computer system requires in fulfilling a task or completing an activity. It is well-known that computers need very little time than humans in completing a task.

- **Accuracy** - If the input data entered into the computer is correct and the set of the instruction given are correct the result produced will be accurate and faster .

- **Memory** - The memory or storage capacity a general computer can store a large amout of data in very small space and retrive the data / informaton instantly and correctly when desire.

- **Automation** - Now a days automation is very general for every one the compter is based on automation is can do many work automatic without any command or without any human interaction
  Example of automation is Artificial intelligence (AI)

![A von Neumann architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg/330px-Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg.png)

**Architecture** - "The complex or carefully designed structure of something."

The Von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann

- The basic concept behing the von Neuman architecture is the ability to store program instruction in memory along with the data on which those instructions operate.

- The Von Neumann architecture describes a general framework, or structure, that a computer's hardware, programming and data should follow.

- Even all the most mordern computers and mobile devices are designed based on this fundamental concept.

- It has 3 basic components:

  1. **I/O Interface**
  2. **CPU**
  3. **Memory**

- Buses (denoted by the arrows) carries the data around

## Classification of Computers

- **Personal computer** - It is a single user computer system having a moderately powerful microprocessor. It is termed as a computer that is equipped microprocessor as its CPU.

- **Workstation** - The workstation is a simliar as personal computer ,but is has more powerful microprocessor than personal computer, a high performance computer system and has a graphics capabilities,and a large storage capacity.

- **Mini computer** - A minicomputer is a type of computer that possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size. mini computer is has also have a large storage capacity in a smaller size.

- **Main frame** -A mainframe is a large computer system designed to process very large amounts of data quickly,The main frame computer have a high processing power as compare to mini computer or other computer.

## Instruction Execution Cycle

instruction execution cycle is a process of the execute of code of instruction in cpu(central processing unit) These instructions are executed by the processor by going through a cycle for each instruction.

In a basic computer, each instruction cycle consists of the following phases:

- Fetch instruction from memory.
- Decode the instruction.
- Read the effective address from memory.
- Execute the instruction.

# Basic Components of a computer system

## Control Unit

Control Unit is a part of the central processing unit , which direct the operation of the process in cpu ,the control unit is direct the computer memory, airthmetic/logic,input and output device how to respond to the instruction that have send to the processor. The functions that a control unit performs are dependent on the type of CPU because the architecture of CPU varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.

Examples of devices that are that utilize Control Unit are:

- GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit)
- CPUs (Control Processing Unit)

## ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the part of a computer processor (CPU) that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words, the ALU is divided in some processor into two part .

1. AU = Arithmetic unit
2. CU = Control unit

## I/O Devices

### Input device

An input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance through the input device the user provide the instruction to cpu and get the output of their instruction.

**Example of input device:**

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Scanner
- Joystick
- Microphones Etc.

### Output Device

An output device is a peice of computer hardware equipment which convert the information that are given by the user through input device the output device convert the instruction into human readable form .

**Example of input device:**- Monitor

- Printer
- Graphic Output Device
- Plotters
- Speakers Etc.

## Memory

A memory is like brain that store data and information Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. the memory is devided into large number of small part called cells , each cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one.

Memory is primarily of three types −

- Cache Memory
- Primary Memory/Main Memory
- Secondary Memory

### Cache memory

Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU.

**Advantages** - The advantages of cache memory are as follows:

- Cache memory is faster than main memory.
- It consumes less access time as compared to main memory.
- It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time.
- It stores data for temporary use.

**Disadvantages** - The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows:

- Cache memory has limited capacity.
- It is very expensive.

### Primary memory

Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. It devide into two subcategories RAM AND ROM.

#### RAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY)

RAM is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.

**Types of RAM are as follow:**

**1. SRAM (Static Random Acess Memory)**

The word static indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied,butas power gets down the data is get lost due to his volatile nature.
SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors.

Characteristic of Static RAM:

- Long life
- No need to refresh
- Faster
- Used as cache memory
- Large size
- Expensive
- High power consumption

**2. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**

DRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually refreshed in order to maintain the data. This is done byplacing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.

Characteristics of Dynamic RAM:

- Short data lifetime
- Needs to be refreshed continuously
- Slower as compared to SRAM
- Used as RAM
- Smaller in size
- Less expensive
- Less power consumption

#### ROM (Read Only Memory)

The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile, in ROM the memory is stored permanetly in such memories during their manufacture, A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer.

**Types of RAM are as follow:**

**1. PROM (Programble And Read Only Memory)**

PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.

**2. EPROM (Erasable And Programmable Read Only Memory)**

EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region.

**3. Flash Memory or EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)**

Flash memory is a non-volatile memory chip used for storage and for transfering data between a personal computer (PC) and digital devices. It has the ability to be electronically reprogrammed and erased.

### Seconday Memeory

Secondary memory refers to storage devices, such as hard drives and solid state drives. It may also refer to removable storage media, such as USB flash drives, CDs, and DVDs. ... Additionally, secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains its data with or without electrical power.

Hard drives, solid state drives, USB Flash drives, CDs, and DVDs are know as Secondary memory. Secondary memory is non-volatile, non-volatile means it retains its data with or without electrical power.

### Other types of memory

- **Auxiliary memory** - Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs, instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded,Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that information can be accessed by the CPU.

  - Non-volatile memory − Data is not lost when power is cut off.

  - Reusable − The data stays in the secondary storage on permanent basis until it is not overwritten or deleted by the user.

  - Reliable − Data in secondary storage is safe because of high physical stability of secondary storage device.

  - Convenience − With the help of a computer software, authorised people can locate and access the data quickly.

  - Capacity − Secondary storage can store large volumes of data in sets of multiple disks.

  - Cost − It is much lesser expensive to store data on a tape or disk than primary memory.

## Software

Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a well-defined function. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.

### Types of Software

There are two types of software −

1. System Software
2. Application Software

### System software

The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers.System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.

**Example of system software**-

- Operating systems like macOS, GNU/Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows
- Device Drivers like BIOS Driver, Display Drivers and Motherboard Drivers etc.

### Application Software

Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software. the application software is desing according to need of the customer , its consists of a collection of the program that have particular task of program .

**Examples of Application software are the following −**

- Payroll Software
- Student Record Software
- Inventory Management Software
- Income Tax Software
- Railways Reservation Software

### Utility Software

These software analyse and maintain a computer. These software are focused on how OS works on that basis it perform task to enable smooth functioning of computer. These software may come along with OS like windows defender, windows disk cleanup tool.

**Example of utility software are:**

- File Viewer.
- File Compressor.
- Diagnostic Utilities.
- Disk Scanner.
- Antivirus.

### Demoware

Software that is used to demonstrate a product's features, but has limitations. It will either expire at a set time, or it is limited in functionality.

# Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system.

## Operating System Functions

The are many type function of operating system some of the function are as follow :

- Memory Management
- Processor Management
- Device Management
- File Management
- Security
- Control over system performance
- Job accounting
- Error detecting aids
- Coordination between other software and users

## Application of operating system

Their are following important activities that an operating system performs -

1. Security
2. Control over system performance
3. Error detection aids
4. Coordination between other software and user

## Types of OS

### Batch Processing

Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts. thier are some following activities related to batch processing
The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.
The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executA single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer.
It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time.

### Single User

A single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer. It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time. It's the most common system used for home computers.

### Multi User

It is an operating system that permits several users to utilize the programs that are concurrently running on a single network server. The single network server is termed as "Terminal server". "Terminal client" is a software that supports user sessions.

### Multiprogramming

Multiprogramming is an extension to the batch processing where the CPU is kept always busy. Each process needs two types of system time: CPU time and IO time.

In multiprogramming environment, for the time a process does its I/O, The CPU can start the execution of other processes. Therefore, multiprogramming improves the efficiency of the system.

### Multi-Tasking

Multitasking is when multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running.
The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, and receives an immediate response.
The OS handles multitasking in the way that it can handle multiple operations/executes multiple programs at a time.

# Programming languages

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.

The programming langugage is classified into two classes
**1. Low-level**
**2. High-level**

## Low level language

Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). but the low level language is faster and precise control over how the computer will work.

## High level language

High-level programming languages are closer to how humans communicate. High-level languages use words that are closer to the words we use in our everyday lives.This means they’re easier to program in than low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.

## Machine language

Machine language is the language understood by a computer. ... All programs and programming languages eventually generate or run programs in machine language. Machine language is made up of instructions and data that are all binary numbers.

## Assembly

Assembly language is a low-level language that needs compiler and interpreter, which converts that language to machine language.

## 4GL ( 4th Generation language)

The fourth-generation languages, or 4GL, are languages that consist of statements similar to statements in a human language. Fourth generation languages are commonly used in database programming and scripts examples include Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL.

# Data representation in computers

**Data** refers to the symbols that represent people,events,things, and ideas .data can be a name ,a number, a colour of a photo.

**Data representation** Data Representation refers to the form in whichdata is stored, processed, and transmitted.

The 0s and 1s used to represent digital data are referred to as binary digits — from this term we get the word bit that stands for binary digit.

- A bit is a 0 or 1 used in the digital representation of data.
- A digital file, usually referred to simply as a file, is a named collection of data that exits on
  a storage medium, such as a hard disk, CD,DVD, or flash drive.

## Computer Viruses

Computer viruses are unwanted software programs or pieces of code that interfere with the functioning of the computer. They spread through contaminated files, data, and insecure networks. Once it enters your system, it can replicate to produce copies of itself to spread from one program to another program and from one infected computer to another computer.

# Disk Operating System (DOS)

MS-DOS is one of the oldest and widely used operating system. DOS is a set of computer programs, the major functions of which are file management, allocation of system resources, providing essential features to control hardware devices.

DOS commands can be typed in either upper case or lower case.

## History & Versions of DOS

DOS was the first operating system used by IBM-compatible computers. It was originally available in two versions that were essentially the same, but marketed under two different names. "PC-DOS" was the version developed by IBM and sold to the first IBM-compatible manufacturers. "MS-DOS" was the version that Microsoft bought the rights to, and was bundled with the first versions of Windows.
The first versions of Windows (through Windows 95) actually ran on top of the DOS operating system. This is why so many DOS-related files (such as .INI, .DLL, and .COM files) are still used by Windows.
DOS is still included with Windows, but is run from the Windows operating system instead of the other way around. The DOS command prompt can be opened in Windows by selecting "Run..." from the Start Menu and typing cmd.

# DOS basics

## Physical structure of disk

Each modern disk contains concentric tracks and each track is divided into multiple sectors. The disks are usually arranged as a one dimensional array of blocks, where blocks are the smallest storage unit.Blocks can also be called as sectors. For each surface of the disk, there is a read/write desk available. The same tracks on all the surfaces is known as a cylinder.

## Drive name

## FAT

A file allocation table (FAT) is a table that an operating system maintains on a hard disk that provides a map of the clusters (the basic units of logical storage on a hard disk) that a file has been stored in. When you write a new file to a hard disk, the file is stored in one or more clusters that are not necessarily next to each other; they may be rather widely scattered over the disk.

## File & Directory structure and naming rules

## Booting process

## DOS system files
