# Definitions and naming conventions for the members of the JAVA classes

> A java program may contain many classes of which only one class will have a main method. Class will contain data members and methods that operate on the data members of the class. To write a Java program, we first need to define classes and then put them together. Generally a standard java program consists of following blocks as shown in below figure.
>
> **Structure:**
>
> ```java
> Package list;
> public Class <class name>
> {
>     Data members;
>     Constructor functions;
>     User-defined methods;
>
>     public static void main (String arguments[])
>     {
>         Block of statements;
>     }
> }
> ```

## Java Naming conventions

> Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.
>
> ### Variable
>
> - It should start with a lowercase letter such as id, name.
> - It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), \_ (underscore).
> - If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName.
> - Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.
>
> ### Class
>
> - It should start with the uppercase letter.
> - It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
> - Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.
>
> ### Interface
>
> - It should start with the uppercase letter.
> - It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
> - Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.
>
> ### Method
>
> - It should start with lowercase letter.
> - It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
> - If the name contains multiple words, start it with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as actionPerformed().
>
> ### Package
>
> - It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang.
> - If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util, java.lang.
>
> ### Constant
>
> - It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW.
> - If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(\_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
> - It may contain digits but not as the first letter.
