There are four prominent generations of computers. Each generation has witnessed several technological advances which change the functionality of the computers. This results in more compact, powerful, robust systems which are less expensive. The computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th century English mathematics professor name Charles Babbage. He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this design that the basic framework of the computers of today are based on.\nComputer system concepts A computer system is a set of integrated device that take input give output and process the command which is given by the user, store data and when the user required some information from the computer it gives that data to the user as per their need.\nCharacteristics   Speed - Speed means the duration computer system requires in fulfilling a task or completing an activity. It is well-known that computers need very little time than humans in completing a task.\n  Accuracy - If the input data entered into the computer is correct and the set of the instruction given are correct the result produced will be accurate and faster .\n  Memory - The memory or storage capacity a general computer can store a large amout of data in very small space and retrive the data / informaton instantly and correctly when desire.\n  Automation - Now a days automation is very general for every one the compter is based on automation is can do many work automatic without any command or without any human interaction Example of automation is Artificial intelligence (AI)\n  Capabilities and limitation Capabilities of computer  Speed Accuracy Reliability Memory Automation  Limitation of computer  Intelligence Feeling No learning power Depends on humans  Generations of Computers Generation includes both hardware and software, which together make up an entire computer system. There are five computer generations known till date. Each generation has been discussed in detail along with their time period and characteristics.\nFirst generation (1946 -1959)  Use of vaccum tube Limited storage Slow speed  Second generation (1959-1965)  Use of transistors and didoes Increased storage capacity Faster speed  Third generation (1965-1971)  Use of integrated circuits More flexibilewith ip/op Smaller size and better performance  Fourth generation (1971-1980)  Use of Integrated Circuits Increased Storage Considerably Faster And Smaller Vlsi Microprocessor Based. (Very Large-Scale Integration )  Fifith generation(1980-onward)  Use of microprocessor based (Ultra Large Scale Integration) AI (Artificial intelligence )  Von Neumann Architecture Architecture - “The complex or carefully designed structure of something.”\nThe Von Neumann architecture—also known as the von Neumann model or Princeton architecture—is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann\n  The basic concept behing the von Neuman architecture is the ability to store program instruction in memory along with the data on which those instructions operate.\n  The Von Neumann architecture describes a general framework, or structure, that a computer’s hardware, programming and data should follow.\n  Even all the most mordern computers and mobile devices are designed based on this fundamental concept.\n  It has 3 basic components:\n I/O Interface CPU Memory    Buses (denoted by the arrows) carries the data around\n  Classification of Computers   Personal computer - It is a single user computer system having a moderately powerful microprocessor. It is termed as a computer that is equipped microprocessor as its CPU.\n  Workstation - The workstation is a simliar as personal computer ,but is has more powerful microprocessor than personal computer, a high performance computer system and has a graphics capabilities,and a large storage capacity.\n  Mini computer - A minicomputer is a type of computer that possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size. mini computer is has also have a large storage capacity in a smaller size.\n  Main frame -A mainframe is a large computer system designed to process very large amounts of data quickly,The main frame computer have a high processing power as compare to mini computer or other computer.\n  Super computer - A supercomputer is a computer that performs at or near the currently highest operational rate for computers.A supercomputer is a computer that performs at or near the currently highest operational rate for computers. the super computer mainly used for scientific and engineering application .\n   Instruction Execution Cycle instruction execution cycle is a process of the execute of code of instruction in cpu(central processing unit) These instructions are executed by the processor by going through a cycle for each instruction.\nIn a basic computer, each instruction cycle consists of the following phases:\n Fetch instruction from memory. Decode the instruction. Read the effective address from memory. Execute the instruction. diagram   Basic Components of a computer system Control Unit Control Unit is a part of the central processing unit , which direct the operation of the process in cpu ,the control unit is direct the computer memory, airthmetic/logic,input and output device how to respond to the instruction that have send to the processor. The functions that a control unit performs are dependent on the type of CPU because the architecture of CPU varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.\nExamples of devices that are that utilize Control Unit are:\n GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) CPUs (Control Processing Unit)  ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the part of a computer processor (CPU) that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words, the ALU is divided in some processor into two part .\n AU = Arithmetic unit CU = Control unit  I/O Devices Input device An input device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance through the input device the user provide the instruction to cpu and get the output of their instruction.\nExample of input device:\n Keyboard Mouse Scanner Joystick Microphones Etc.  Output Device An output device is a peice of computer hardware equipment which convert the information that are given by the user through input device the output device convert the instruction into human readable form .\nExample of input device:- Monitor\n Printer Graphic Output Device Plotters Speakers Etc.  Memory A memory is like brain that store data and information Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. the memory is devided into large number of small part called cells , each cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one.\nMemory is primarily of three types −\n Cache Memory Primary Memory/Main Memory Secondary Memory  Cache memory Cache memory is a very high speed semiconductor memory which can speed up the CPU. It acts as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory. It is used to hold those parts of data and program which are most frequently used by the CPU.\nAdvantages - The advantages of cache memory are as follows:\n Cache memory is faster than main memory. It consumes less access time as compared to main memory. It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time. It stores data for temporary use.  Disadvantages - The disadvantages of cache memory are as follows:\n Cache memory has limited capacity. It is very expensive.  Primary memory Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off. It is generally made up of semiconductor device. It devide into two subcategories RAM AND ROM.\nRAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY) RAM is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.\nTypes of RAM are as follow:\n1. SRAM (Static Random Acess Memory)\nThe word static indicates that the memory retains its contents as long as power is being supplied,butas power gets down the data is get lost due to his volatile nature. SRAM chips use a matrix of 6-transistors and no capacitors.\nCharacteristic of Static RAM:\n Long life No need to refresh Faster Used as cache memory Large size Expensive High power consumption  2. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)\nDRAM, unlike SRAM, must be continually refreshed in order to maintain the data. This is done byplacing the memory on a refresh circuit that rewrites the data several hundred times per second. All DRAMs are made up of memory cells, which are composed of one capacitor and one transistor.\nCharacteristics of Dynamic RAM:\n Short data lifetime Needs to be refreshed continuously Slower as compared to SRAM Used as RAM Smaller in size Less expensive Less power consumption  ROM (Read Only Memory) The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile, in ROM the memory is stored permanetly in such memories during their manufacture, A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer.\nTypes of RAM are as follow:\n1. PROM (Programble And Read Only Memory)\nPROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.\n2. EPROM (Erasable And Programmable Read Only Memory)\nEPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region.\n3. Flash Memory or EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)\nFlash memory is a non-volatile memory chip used for storage and for transfering data between a personal computer (PC) and digital devices. It has the ability to be electronically reprogrammed and erased.\nSeconday Memeory Secondary memory refers to storage devices, such as hard drives and solid state drives. It may also refer to removable storage media, such as USB flash drives, CDs, and DVDs. … Additionally, secondary memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains its data with or without electrical power.\nHard drives, solid state drives, USB Flash drives, CDs, and DVDs are know as Secondary memory. Secondary memory is non-volatile, non-volatile means it retains its data with or without electrical power.\nOther types of memory   Auxiliary memory - Auxiliary memory is much larger in size than main memory but is slower. It normally stores system programs, instruction and data files. It is also known as secondary memory. It can also be used as an overflow/virtual memory in case the main memory capacity has been exceeded,Secondary memories cannot be accessed directly by a processor. First the data/information of auxiliary memory is transferred to the main memory and then that information can be accessed by the CPU.\n  Non-volatile memory − Data is not lost when power is cut off.\n  Reusable − The data stays in the secondary storage on permanent basis until it is not overwritten or deleted by the user.\n  Reliable − Data in secondary storage is safe because of high physical stability of secondary storage device.\n  Convenience − With the help of a computer software, authorised people can locate and access the data quickly.\n  Capacity − Secondary storage can store large volumes of data in sets of multiple disks.\n  Cost − It is much lesser expensive to store data on a tape or disk than primary memory.\n     Software Software is a set of programs, which is designed to perform a well-defined function. A program is a sequence of instructions written to solve a particular problem.\nTypes of Software There are two types of software −\n System Software Application Software  System software The system software is a collection of programs designed to operate, control, and extend the processing capabilities of the computer itself. System software is generally prepared by the computer manufacturers.System software serves as the interface between the hardware and the end users.\nExample of system software-\n Operating systems like macOS, GNU/Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows Device Drivers like BIOS Driver, Display Drivers and Motherboard Drivers etc.  Application Software Application software products are designed to satisfy a particular need of a particular environment. All software applications prepared in the computer lab can come under the category of Application software. the application software is desing according to need of the customer , its consists of a collection of the program that have particular task of program .\nExamples of Application software are the following −\n Payroll Software Student Record Software Inventory Management Software Income Tax Software Railways Reservation Software  Utility Software These software analyse and maintain a computer. These software are focused on how OS works on that basis it perform task to enable smooth functioning of computer. These software may come along with OS like windows defender, windows disk cleanup tool.\nExample of utility software are:\n File Viewer. File Compressor. Diagnostic Utilities. Disk Scanner. Antivirus.  Demoware Software that is used to demonstrate a product’s features, but has limitations. It will either expire at a set time, or it is limited in functionality.\n Operating Systems An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system.\nOperating System Functions The are many type function of operating system some of the function are as follow :\n Memory Management Processor Management Device Management File Management Security Control over system performance Job accounting Error detecting aids Coordination between other software and users  Application of operating system Their are following important activities that an operating system performs -\n Security Control over system performance Error detection aids Coordination between other software and user  Types of OS Batch Processing Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts. thier are some following activities related to batch processing The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit. The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executA single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer. It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time.\nSingle User A single-user operating system is a type of system that has been developed and designed to use on a computer. It can be used on a similar device, and it only has one user at a time. It’s the most common system used for home computers.\nMulti User It is an operating system that permits several users to utilize the programs that are concurrently running on a single network server. The single network server is termed as “Terminal server”. “Terminal client” is a software that supports user sessions.\nMultiprogramming Multiprogramming is an extension to the batch processing where the CPU is kept always busy. Each process needs two types of system time: CPU time and IO time.\nIn multiprogramming environment, for the time a process does its I/O, The CPU can start the execution of other processes. Therefore, multiprogramming improves the efficiency of the system.\nMulti-Tasking Multitasking is when multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running. The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, and receives an immediate response. The OS handles multitasking in the way that it can handle multiple operations/executes multiple programs at a time.\n Programming languages A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.\nThe programming langugage is classified into two classes 1. Low-level 2. High-level\nLow level language Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). but the low level language is faster and precise control over how the computer will work.\nHigh level language High-level programming languages are closer to how humans communicate. High-level languages use words that are closer to the words we use in our everyday lives.This means they’re easier to program in than low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.\nMachine language Machine language is the language understood by a computer. … All programs and programming languages eventually generate or run programs in machine language. Machine language is made up of instructions and data that are all binary numbers.\nAssembly Assembly language is a low-level language that needs compiler and interpreter, which converts that language to machine language.\n4GL ( 4th Generation language) The fourth-generation languages, or 4GL, are languages that consist of statements similar to statements in a human language. Fourth generation languages are commonly used in database programming and scripts examples include Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and SQL.\n Data representation in computers Data refers to the symbols that represent people,events,things, and ideas .data can be a name ,a number, a colour of a photo.\nData representation Data Representation refers to the form in whichdata is stored, processed, and transmitted.\nThe 0s and 1s used to represent digital data are referred to as binary digits — from this term we get the word bit that stands for binary digit.\n A bit is a 0 or 1 used in the digital representation of data. A digital file, usually referred to simply as a file, is a named collection of data that exits on a storage medium, such as a hard disk, CD,DVD, or flash drive.   Computer Viruses Computer viruses are unwanted software programs or pieces of code that interfere with the functioning of the computer. They spread through contaminated files, data, and insecure networks. Once it enters your system, it can replicate to produce copies of itself to spread from one program to another program and from one infected computer to another computer.\n Disk Operating System (DOS) MS-DOS is one of the oldest and widely used operating system. DOS is a set of computer programs, the major functions of which are file management, allocation of system resources, providing essential features to control hardware devices.\nDOS commands can be typed in either upper case or lower case.\nHistory \u0026 Versions of DOS DOS was the first operating system used by IBM-compatible computers. It was originally available in two versions that were essentially the same, but marketed under two different names. “PC-DOS” was the version developed by IBM and sold to the first IBM-compatible manufacturers. “MS-DOS” was the version that Microsoft bought the rights to, and was bundled with the first versions of Windows. The first versions of Windows (through Windows 95) actually ran on top of the DOS operating system. This is why so many DOS-related files (such as .INI, .DLL, and .COM files) are still used by Windows. DOS is still included with Windows, but is run from the Windows operating system instead of the other way around. The DOS command prompt can be opened in Windows by selecting “Run…” from the Start Menu and typing cmd.\n DOS basics Physical structure of disk Each modern disk contains concentric tracks and each track is divided into multiple sectors. The disks are usually arranged as a one dimensional array of blocks, where blocks are the smallest storage unit.Blocks can also be called as sectors. For each surface of the disk, there is a read/write desk available. The same tracks on all the surfaces is known as a cylinder.\nDrive name FAT A file allocation table (FAT) is a table that an operating system maintains on a hard disk that provides a map of the clusters (the basic units of logical storage on a hard disk) that a file has been stored in. When you write a new file to a hard disk, the file is stored in one or more clusters that are not necessarily next to each other; they may be rather widely scattered over the disk.\nFile \u0026 Directory structure and naming rules Booting process DOS system files  Basic DOS Commands There are some DOS command as follow :\n   Command Usage     ASSOC Displays or modifies file extension associations.

PROM (Programble And Read Only Memory)</strong></p><p>PROM is read-only memory that can be modified only once by a user. The user buys a blank PROM and enters the desired contents using a PROM program. Inside the PROM chip, there are small fuses which are burnt open during programming. It can be programmed only once and is not erasable.</p><p><strong>2. EPROM (Erasable And Programmable Read Only Memory)</strong></p><p>EPROM can be erased by exposing it to ultra-violet light for a duration of up to 40 minutes. Usually, an EPROM eraser achieves this function. During programming, an electrical charge is trapped in an insulated gate region.</p><p><strong>3. Flash Memory or EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)</strong></p><p>Flash memory is a non-volatile memory chip used for storage and for transfering data between a personal computer (PC) and digital devices.

DOS is a set of computer programs, the major functions of which are file management, allocation of system resources, providing essential features to control hardware devices.</p><p>DOS commands can be typed in either upper case or lower case.</p><h2 id=history--versions-of-dos>History & Versions of DOS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#history--versions-of-dos>#</a></h2><p>DOS was the first operating system used by IBM-compatible computers. It was originally available in two versions that were essentially the same, but marketed under two different names. &ldquo;PC-DOS&rdquo; was the version developed by IBM and sold to the first IBM-compatible manufacturers. &ldquo;MS-DOS&rdquo; was the version that Microsoft bought the rights to, and was bundled with the first versions of Windows.
The first versions of Windows (through Windows 95) actually ran on top of the DOS operating system. This is why so many DOS-related files (such as .INI, .DLL, and .COM files) are still used by Windows.
DOS is still included with Windows, but is run from the Windows operating system instead of the other way around. The DOS command prompt can be opened in Windows by selecting &ldquo;Run&mldr;&rdquo; from the Start Menu and typing cmd.</p><hr><h1 id=dos-basics>DOS basics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dos-basics>#</a></h1><h2 id=physical-structure-of-disk>Physical structure of disk<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#physical-structure-of-disk>#</a></h2><p>Each modern disk contains concentric tracks and each track is divided into multiple sectors. The disks are usually arranged as a one dimensional array of blocks, where blocks are the smallest storage unit.Blocks can also be called as sectors. For each surface of the disk, there is a read/write desk available. The same tracks on all the surfaces is known as a cylinder.</p><h2 id=drive-name>Drive name<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#drive-name>#</a></h2><h2 id=fat>FAT<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fat>#</a></h2><p>A file allocation table (FAT) is a table that an operating system maintains on a hard disk that provides a map of the clusters (the basic units of logical storage on a hard disk) that a file has been stored in. When you write a new file to a hard disk, the file is stored in one or more clusters that are not necessarily next to each other; they may be rather widely scattered over the disk.</p><h2 id=file--directory-structure-and-naming-rules>File & Directory structure and naming rules<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#file--directory-structure-and-naming-rules>#</a></h2><h2 id=booting-process>Booting process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#booting-process>#</a></h2><h2 id=dos-system-files>DOS system files<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dos-system-files>#</a></h2><hr><h1 id=basic-dos-commands>Basic DOS Commands<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#basic-dos-commands>#</a></h1><p>There are some DOS command as follow :</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Command</strong></th><th><strong>Usage</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ASSOC</strong></td><td>Displays or modifies file extension associations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ATTRIB</strong></td><td>Displays or changes file attributes.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BREAK</strong></td><td>Sets or clears extended CTRL+C checking.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BCDEDIT</strong></td><td>Sets properties in boot database to control boot loading.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CACLS</strong></td><td>Displays or modifies access control lists (ACLs) of files.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CALL</strong></td><td>Calls one batch program from another.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CD</strong></td><td>Displays the name of or changes the current directory.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CHCP</strong></td><td>Displays or sets the active code page number.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CHDIR</strong></td><td>Displays the name of or changes the current directory.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CHKDSK</strong></td><td>Checks a disk and displays a status report.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CHKNTFS</strong></td><td>Displays or modifies the checking of disk at boot time.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CLS</strong></td><td>Clears the screen.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CMD</strong></td><td>Starts a new instance of the Windows command interpreter.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>COLOR</strong></td><td>Sets the default console foreground and background colors.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>COMP</strong></td><td>Compares the contents of two files or sets of files.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>COMPACT</strong></td><td>Displays or alters the compression of files on NTFS partitions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CONVERT</strong></td><td>Converts FAT volumes to NTFS.
