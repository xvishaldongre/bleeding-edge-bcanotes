Think of your network as a city, and the topology as the road map.\nTypes of Network Topologies 1. Physical The actual connections (wires, cables, etc.) of how the network is arranged.\n P2P Topology - The network consists of a direct link between two computers.  Advantages  Faster and highly reliable Not need an expensive server   Disadvantages  Small area only No security besides permissions     Bus Topology - Every computer and network device is connected to single cable  Features  Transmit data only in one direction Every device is connected to a single cable   Advantages  Low Cost Moderate data speed Least cable required Easy to understand Easy to expand Limited failure   Disadvantages  Cable fails then whole newtwork fails. Slower than ring topology     Ring Topology - Every device has exactly two neighboring devices for communication purpose, every computer is connected to another computer.  Advantages  Low cost Easier to install Easy to expand   Disadvantages  Troubleshooting is difficult Adding or deleting can disturbs the network Failure in one disturbs the whole network.     Star Topology - All the computers connect with a hub. This cable is called a central node, and all other nodes are connected using this central node.  Advantages  Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic. Easy to troubleshoot. Easy to setup and modify. Only that node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes can work smoothly.   Disadvantages  High Cost If hub fails then whole network is stopped Performance is based on hub     Tree Topology - It have a root node, and all other nodes are connected which form a hierarchy  Advantages  Expansion is Easy Easily managed and maintained Easy error detection   Disadvantages  Heavily cabled Costly Root node fails then whole network fails     Mesh Topology - Each computer on the network connects to every other  Advantages  Fault is diagnosed easily. Provides security and privacy.   Disadvantages  Installation and configuration is difficult. High cabling Cost Bulk wiring     Hybrid Topology - Combination two or more topologies  Advantages  Scalable as size can be increased easily. Flexible.   Disadvantages Complex in design. Costly    2. Logical Higher-level idea of how the network is set up, including which nodes connect to each other and in which ways, as well as how data is transmitted through the network. Logical network topology includes any virtual and cloud resources.\n LAN Components 1. Hardware Components Following are the Hardware components-\n Network Adapter Cards or Networking Interface Card (NICs) - Circuit board or card installed in computer so that it can be connected to a network. Server - A computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other (client) computers over a local network or the Internet. A server may be three types:  File Server: A file server is a computer that stores files, is attached to a network, and provides shared access of those files to multiple workstation computers. Print Server: A print server is a device that connects printers to client computers over a network. It accepts print request from the computers and sends the jobs to the appropriate printers over the LAN. Communication Server: A communication server is a computer system designed to handle a wide range of communications-based applications.   Station - A station is a computer that is connected with a server computer over the LAN, and communicate with other devices connected with it. HUB - A common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives atone port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all-packets. Switch - A switch is like a hub in that it is a central point for connecting network cables; however, a switch is able to receive a packet and transmit it to only the destination computer. Router - Routers make the connection to the Internet for LANs. They use a configuration table to decide where packets should go. Access point - A hardware device or a computer’s software that acts as a communication hub for users of a wireless device to connect to a wired LAN. Power Supply - Both wired and wireless networks need a power supply. A wireless network uses the current to generate radio waves. A cabled network sends data interpreted as an electronic pulse. Connector - A network connector refers to any device that used to connect many LAN connection with the hardware of the computer. Shared Peripheral Device - A peripheral device is any device—such as a printer, hard disk drive, CD-ROM drive or modem—that is connected to and controlled by a computer. Any or all of these devices can be accessed by multiple users when connected to a LAN in the proper manner.  2. LAN Software  Operating system of Server Opetating system of client (workstations) Application software accessed by LAN User  3. Users  Users (Normal people who uses network resources.) Network Administrators (People who manages LAN network)   Newtorking/Transmission mediums Communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through the electromagnetic signals.\nGuided Media It is a wired transmission media, in which data signals are guided along a physical path i.e. within a wire.\n  Twisted pair Cable - The wires are twisted to reduce cross talk and electrical interference.\nInvented by - Alexander Graham Bell in 1881.\n Advantages  Easier to install Useful and inexpensive Used for analog or digital transmission   Disadvantages  Easily pick noise signal    Types of Twisted pair Cable:\n Shielded Unshielded    Coxial Cable - A group of wrapped and insulated wire line. They transmit data at higher rates.\nThe outer conductor acts as a shield against noise.\n Advantages  Used in cable television Higher bandwidth Preferred for long distance telephone lines Better shield Data transmission without any distortion. Higher noise immunity    Types od Coxial Cable:\n Baseband Broadband    Fiber Optic Cable - Also known as Optical Fibre provides high quality transmission of signals at high speed.\nIt has a glass core in the center.\n Advantages  It not get affected by electromagnetic interference. High quality transmission of signals at very high speed      Unguided Media To exchange bits of data for laptop, notebook, smart watch, without wires you need wireless communication.\n  Radio Transmission- Used globally for communication\nTravels long distances and even penetrate buildings with ease,\nOmnidirectional travel in all the directions\nRadio communication has eight ranges, also called bands and all regulated by government authorities.\n  Radio frequencies (Bands):\n VLF - Very Low Frequency for submarine communication LF - Low Frequency for long-range navigation. MF - Middle Frequency for AM radio. HF - High Frequency for long distance ship and aircraft communication. VHF - Very High Frequency for FM radio. UHF - Ultra High Frequency for Television, mobile telephone communication. SHF - Superhigh frequency for terrestrial and satellite microwave. EHF - Extremely high frequency for radar.      Microwave Transmission- Microwave transmission use lower gigahertz frequency of the electronic magnetic spectrum\nRequire line-of-sight transmission\nTypes:\n Terrestrial Microwave Satellite Communication     Guided vs UnGuided Transmission Media |Basic|Guided/ Bounded Media| UnGuided/ UnBounded Media| |— |—|—| |Transmission| Wired| Wireless| |Also, called?| Bounded Transmission Media| UnBounded Transmission Media| |Media Types| Twisted Pair Cable, Coaxial cable, Fiber Optic cable, etc| Microwave Transmission, Satellite Communication, etc.| |Media| Seen and touched i.e. tangible | Cannot be seen and touched i.e intangible| |Distance| Shorter Distance| Larger Distance|\n Comparison of Guided and UnGuided Transmission Media |Medium|Attenuation|Electromagnetic Interface|Security|Cost| |— |—|—|—|—| |Unshielded Twisted Pair| High| High| Low| Low| |Shielded Twisted Pair|High|Moderate|Low |Moderate| |Coaxial Cable|Moderate|Moderate|Low|Moderate| |Fiber Optic Cable|Low| Low| High|High| |Radio Waves|Low to High| High| Low| Moderate| |Microwave Transmission| Can be higher or lower or moderate| High| Moderate| High| |Satellite Communication|Can be higher or lower or moderate| High| Moderate| Very High|\n Digital Data Rate or Data Transfer Rate (DTR) Rate of speed at which the data is transferred from one point to another. Its measurement unit is bits per second (bps), Bytes per second (Bps).\nOther Forms | RATE | DENOTED BY |FULL FORM |— |—|—| | Rate of thousand bits per second |kbps | Kilobits per second | | Rate of thousand bytes per second |Kbps | Kilobytes per second | | Rate of million bits per second |mbps | Megabits per second | | Rate of Million bytes per second |Mbps | Megabytes per second |\n Serial Data Format Low-level protocol for communicating between two or more devices.\nSends and receives bytes of information in a serial fashion—one bit at a time.\nThese bytes are transmitted using either a binary format or a text (ASCII) format.\nEncoded data Formats Encoding- The process of converting the data or a given sequence of characters, symbols, alphabets etc., into a specified format.\nDecoding- the reverse process of encoding which is to extract the information from the converted format.\nData Encoding - The process of using various patterns of voltage or current levels to represent 1s and 0s of the digital signals on the transmission link.\n Encoding Techniques  Analog data to Analog signals Analog data to Digital signals Digital data to Analog signals Digital data to Digital signals     Connection Oriented and Connectionless services Connection-oriented service and Connection-less service are used for the connection establishment between two or more than two devices.\nConnection-oriented service It is related to the telephone system. It includes the connection establishment and connection termination. In connection-oriented service, Handshake method is used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.\nTCP (Transmission control protocol) is connection oriented network.\n In this first connection is made before sending the message It is a stream based transmission In this receiver is first checked for authentication so chances of getting error are very less. It is more reliable network.  Connection-less service Connection-less service is related to the postal system. It does not include any connection establishment and connection termination. Connection-less Service does not give the guarantee of reliability.\nUDP(User Datagram Protocol) is connection-less oriented network.\n In this no connection is established prior to sending message. It transmits data as message. There is no need to authenticate, so more likely to have error. It is unreliable network.   Switching Techniques In large networks, there can be multiple paths from sender to receiver. The switching technique will decide the best route for data transmission.\nClassification::\n Circuit Switching  Space Division Switch  Crossbar Switch Multistage Switch   Time Division Switch   Message Switching Packet Switching  Datagram Approch Virtual Circuit Approach  Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)      Circuit Switching  It establishes a dedicated path between sender and receiver. Once the connection is established then the dedicated path will remain to exist until the connection is terminated. In a network operates in a similar way as the telephone works. A complete end-to-end path must exist before the communication takes place. Before sending data a request signal is sent to recevier then the receiver sends back the acknowledgment Fixed data can be transferred at a time  Message Switching It is a connectionless network switching technique where the entire message is routed from the source node to the destination node, one node at a time.\nPacket Switching  Connectionless network switching technique The message is divided and grouped into a number of units called packets Packets has two parts: a header and a payload. Header contains the addressing information Payload carries the actual data    More Resources Overview of Computer Networking\nBasics of Computer Networking\nComputer Networks Tutorial | Studytonight\nComputer Networks Tutorial - Studyopedia\n","wordCount":"2438","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-10-19T16:11:33+05:30","dateModified":"2020-10-19T16:11:33+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vishal Dongre, Tanmay, Varun and Shivam"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://601a5ef96a29efb2a3d0bfe2--laughing-shirley-c9d584.netlify.app/computer-neworks/unit-1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"BCA Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://601a5ef96a29efb2a3d0bfe2--laughing-shirley-c9d584.netlify.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top style="font-family:Patrick Hand"><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://601a5ef96a29efb2a3d0bfe2--laughing-shirley-c9d584.netlify.app/ accesskey=h title="BCA Notes (Alt + H)">BCA Notes</a>
